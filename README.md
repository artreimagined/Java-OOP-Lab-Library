# Java-OOP-Lab-Library

The libraries of SmallTownX need a new electronic rental system, and it is up to you to build it. SmallTownX has two libraries. Each library offers many books to rent. Customers can print the list of available books, borrow, and return books. 

We provide two classes, Book and Library, that provide the functionality for the book database. You must implement the missing methods to make these classes work.
